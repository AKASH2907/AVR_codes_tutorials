# AVR_codes_tutorials
AVR Codes for basic LED patterns contol to specialized functions such as Timer controls, Mulitple Interrupts, LCD, Edge Avoiding Bots, Vending Machines, etc.

The details of the codes are as follows:

[1] [LED_BLINK_SW](https://github.com/AKASH2907/AVR_codes_tutorials/tree/master/1.LED_BLINK_SW): The first code is just to inittialize ATmega16 board and does nothing.

[2] [LED_PORTA_ANTI_CLOCK_SIMULTANEOUS](https://github.com/AKASH2907/AVR_codes_tutorials/tree/master/1.LED_PORTA_ANTI_CLOCK_SIMULTANEOUS): It is the starting of the tutorials for ATmega16 microcontroller codes. In this program, the LED blinks simultaneously in clockwise and anticlockwise direction with a delay of 100ms.
