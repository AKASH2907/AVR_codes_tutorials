AVR Codes for basic LED patterns contol to specialized functions such as Timer controls, Mulitple Interrupts, LCD, Edge Avoiding Bots, Vending Machines, etc.

ATmega 8/16 is a 8/16 bit microcontroller. The detailed datasheet of ATmega 8/16 can be read from [here](https://www.gme.cz/data/attachments/dsh.958-112.1.pdf) to know more about the specialized PIN functions. The codes were written in ATmel studio and for the designing of circuits PROTEUS software is used. You can find the design files(.dsn) inside each folder of the code. 

The details of the codes are as follows:

[1] [LED_BLINK_SW](https://github.com/AKASH2907/AVR_codes_tutorials/tree/master/1.LED_BLINK_SW): The first code is just to inittialize ATmega8 board and does nothing.

[2] [LED_PORTA_ANTI_CLOCK_SIMULTANEOUS](https://github.com/AKASH2907/AVR_codes_tutorials/tree/master/1.LED_PORTA_ANTI_CLOCK_SIMULTANEOUS): It is the starting of the tutorials for ATmega8 microcontroller codes. In this program, the LED blinks simultaneously in clockwise and anticlockwise direction with a delay of 100ms.

[3] [LED_PORTA_C_A_ARRAY]():
