AVR Codes for basic LED patterns contol to specialized functions such as Timer controls, Mulitple Interrupts, LCD, Edge Avoiding Bots, Vending Machines, etc.

ATmega 8/16 is a 8/16 bit microcontroller. The detailed datasheet of ATmega 8/16 can be read from [here](https://www.gme.cz/data/attachments/dsh.958-112.1.pdf) to know more about the specialized PIN functions. 

The details of the codes are as follows:

[1] [LED_BLINK_SW](https://github.com/AKASH2907/AVR_codes_tutorials/tree/master/1.LED_BLINK_SW): The first code is just to inittialize ATmega8 board and does nothing.

[2] [LED_PORTA_ANTI_CLOCK_SIMULTANEOUS](https://github.com/AKASH2907/AVR_codes_tutorials/tree/master/1.LED_PORTA_ANTI_CLOCK_SIMULTANEOUS): It is the starting of the tutorials for ATmega8 microcontroller codes. In this program, the LED blinks simultaneously in clockwise and anticlockwise direction with a delay of 100ms.

[3] [LED_PORTA_C_A_ARRAY]():
